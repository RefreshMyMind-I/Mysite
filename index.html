                        that you’re maneuvering a device from a first-person perspective. While FPV usually involves a

                    <p>BMP280 is a high precision sensor module that measures the atmospheric pressure and temperature
                        in air. Not only this, but it can also measure humidity in the air. This six-pin module supports
                        both SPI and I2C interfaces.<span id="dots"></span><span id="more">It uses a BMP280 barometric
                            pressure sensor. These sensors are pre-calibrated, unlike other sensors. Therefore, they
                            start measuring temperature, pressure, and humidity instantly after powering them. You don’t
                            need extra components for its calibration or operation.</span>
