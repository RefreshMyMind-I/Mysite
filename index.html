                        that you’re maneuvering a device from a first-person perspective. While FPV usually involves a

                            radio-controlled device can be called FPV if you’re
                            looking from the view of the camera embedded on the device. These include fixed-wing planes,
                            RCcars, and even boats.This is an Fpv quad Which I built in 2019.You probably already know

                    <p>BMP280 is a high precision sensor module that measures the atmospheric pressure and temperature
                        in air. Not only this, but it can also measure humidity in the air. This six-pin module supports
                        both SPI and I2C interfaces.<span id="dots1"></span><span id="more1">It uses a BMP280 barometric
                            pressure sensor. These sensors are pre-calibrated, unlike other sensors. Therefore, they
                            start measuring temperature, pressure, and humidity instantly after powering them. You don’t
                            need extra components for its calibration or operation.</span>

                    <p>Microstepping is a method of controlling stepper motors, typically used to achieve higher
                        resolution or smoother motion at low speeds. Stepper motors move in discrete steps, or fractions
                        of a revolution. For example, a stepper motor with a 1.8 degree step angle will make 200 steps
                        for every full revolution of the motor (360 ÷ 1.8)</p>
