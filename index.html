                    <p>You probably already know that FPV stands for first person view. The name comes from the fact
                        that you’re maneuvering a device from a first-person perspective. While FPV usually involves a
                        quadcopter drone, technically, any kind of radio-controlled device can be called FPV if you’re
                        looking from the view of the camera embedded on the device. These include fixed-wing planes, RC
                        cars, and even boats.<p style="padding: 2px; margin: 2px">
                        For all intents and purposes, we’ll really only be talking about quadcopters because over the
                        years, the popularity of FPV quads has surged. Prices for drones and parts have dipped allowing
                        more people to get into the hobby. Parts for quadcopters have continued to improve over time.
                        And a community of support across the hobby has continued to grow. We at QuadPartPicker aim to
                        expand this even further to help newbies and veterans alike to get into the air faster and more
                        efficiently by giving you a centralized place to find and pick parts and equipment for your own
                        custom setup.
